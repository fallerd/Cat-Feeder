# Cat-Feeder

Arduino based 3D printed automatic cat feeder based on concept designed by kitlaan on thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27854

STL's are included for printing the parts as well as arduino code. The PVC used I belive is a 1 1/2" tee. The motor that fits these parts is the following:

Also, a regular arduino relay is necessary as well as a 12v power supply.
